# OpenCV_Project
Just a fun project to test some of the very basic capabilities of OpenCV using C++

main.cpp file is to be run. image_processing cpp and header files should be kept in the same directory as the main.cpp file for easier compilation. Otherwise include paths should 
be updated.

Present functions for image processing:
1: Finding HSV color code of a particular object in image for further processing. Using realtime trackbars.
2: Finding and drawing detected contours
  

New functions and features can easily be added to the project.
