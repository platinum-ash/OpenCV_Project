# OpenCV_Project
A fun project to test some of the very basic capabilities of OpenCV using C++  
# Dependancies
Needs OpenCV library to be installed on the system.  
main.cpp file is to be run. image_processing cpp and header files should be kept in the same directory as the main.cpp file for easier compilation. Otherwise include paths should 
be updated. Compilation should properly include OpenCV library. 

# Present functions for image processing:
1: Finding HSV(Hue, Saturation and Value) color code of a particular object in image for further processing. Using realtime trackbars.  
2: Finding and drawing detected contours  
3: Detecting basic and obvious shapes (Circle, triangle, rectangle)  
4: Scan Document ( Extracts a rectangular document from the image and changes perspective to present a scan )  

New functions and features can easily be added to the project.

# TODO
Add feature to accept command line argument for path of the image
